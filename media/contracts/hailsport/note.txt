    My Envoy! You have been chosen for this mission as YOU are the quickest and most trustworthiest person in our fleets! ENTER_LINE The Anglemount's are a far trek from home, yes, but its nothing you can't make I'd imagine! We've given you our house crest as representative of us all. Now, this isn't all fun and games, however. ENTER_LINE Firstly, meet with all other envoys! See what they're up to and report back to us what you've learned of each family! I do enjoy hearing their livelies, and this is a far quicker way to gain this info than mail and carriage! HAHA, well, anyways, be safe now you hear! And find out how the Anglemount's are! I must have forgotten about them in my old age, so little have I heard from them I suspect the cause. ENTER_LINE Safe travels my friend and comrade! ENTER_LINE ~ Drackle Hailsport
