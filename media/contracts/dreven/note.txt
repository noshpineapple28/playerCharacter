    Dear Envoy, you have been chosen to ride out upon strange lands. Far from here is Anglemount, but I trust you can do it. There is something you should know upon going to the manor. There will be many houses, but ours is not seen as the strongest. Do what is necessary to survive if needed, but don't be reckless. ENTER_LINE Be it Corendeck's secrecy, Hailsport's aloofness, or Regendale's might, none would last a second without us. Without you. But make a wrong step, and there's nothing we can do to stop what they do, and what the houses do next. ENTER_LINE The crest is in your hands, be safe my love, ENTER_LINE ~ Lucy Dreven
